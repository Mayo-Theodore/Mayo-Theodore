### :star: &nbsp; Motivation

I'm an alumnus of Makers and a full-stack Software Engineer. I have a varied background, having worked most recently within the financial technology sector as an analyst at OpenGamma.

I am passionate about technology and software development, as it allows us to create cutting-edge products and solutions to real-world issues. Learning to program has enhanced my critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

### üõ† &nbsp; Projects

I studied at Makers Academy. The course focused on pair programming, test-driven development, agile processes, and learning by doing. I also picked up two mentees along the way!

Here's a selection of my projects demonstrating my technology and language skills.
